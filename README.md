Project details:

1-Audit the existing website by identifying relevant SEO and accessibility issues, noting an explanation and a credible reference (documentation, research paper, journal…) for each one. Your audit will include a selection of at least 10 actions to take to improve the website’s accessibility and/or SEO (including size and speed).

2-Apply your recommendations to the code and submit the full source code of the improved website. The W3C HTML and CSS validator should not reveal any errors. 

3-Demonstrate that your adjustments have improved the website by providing a before-and-after comparison of the results from Google’s Lighthouse tool, accounting for all action taken to optimize the website.
